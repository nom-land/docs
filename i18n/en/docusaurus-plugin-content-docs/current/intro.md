# Introduction

## What is Nomland Protocol?

Nomland is a protocol for sharing, reviewing and recommending. It organizes a variety of content and records the value involved throughout the entire cycle of sharing, reviewing and recommending.

## Why do we need Nomland?

For scenarios that have not yet been documented, Nomland is exploring how to establish new apps on top of them (Colib is one of the first attempts). For sharing scenarios that have been documented(such as Dianping, Yelp, Douban, â€¦), Nomland will provide a value distribution engine to help improve them.

## QuickStart
